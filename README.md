Space Debris Detection 🚀
Overview 🌌
This project trains a YOLOv8 model to detect space debris and satellites in images! 📸 It uses the Roboflow platform to download a dataset and Ultralytics YOLO for object detection. Perfect for space enthusiasts! 🪐
Features ✨

Detects Space Objects: Identifies debris and satellites like CHEOPS, SOHO, and more 🛰️
YOLOv8 Model: Trains a lightweight YOLOv8n model for fast detection ⚡
Roboflow Integration: Downloads the "Space-debris-2" dataset automatically 📥
Training Metrics: Tracks box loss, classification loss, and more 📊
Image Prediction: Tests the model on sample images with confidence scores 🖼️

Requirements 🛠️

Python 3.12+ 🐍
Libraries:
roboflow 🌐
ultralytics (YOLO) 🔍
opencv-python-headless 📷
numpy 🔢
matplotlib 📈
Pillow 🖼️



Installation ⚙️

Clone the repo:git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-debris-detection.git
cd space-debris-detection


Install packages:pip install roboflow ultralytics opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib Pillow


Get a Roboflow API key from Roboflow 🔑

Usage 🎯

Update the Roboflow API key in the notebook:rf = Roboflow(api_key="your-api-key-here")


Run the Jupyter notebook:jupyter notebook space_debris_detection.ipynb


The notebook will:
Download the "Space-debris-2" dataset 📦
Train a YOLOv8n model for 10 epochs 🧠
Save results in runs/detect/trainX 📁
Predict on a sample image and show results 🖥️


View training plots and predictions in the notebook or runs/detect folder 📈

File Structure 📁

space_debris_detection.ipynb: Main notebook for dataset download, training, and prediction 🖥️
README.md: This guide! 📝
Space-debris-2/: Downloaded dataset folder (auto-generated) 📷

Notes 📌

Training runs on CPU; GPU can speed it up if available ⚡
Dataset includes 2721 training and 239 validation images 🖼️
Model detects 11 classes (e.g., debris, CHEOPS, SOHO) 🌠
Prediction confidence threshold is set to 0.25 by default 🎯
Check data.yaml in the dataset folder for configuration 🔍

Troubleshooting 🐛

API key error?: Verify your Roboflow API key 🔑
Dataset not found?: Ensure internet connection for download 🌐
Slow training?: Reduce batch size or use a GPU 🖥️
Prediction issues?: Check image path and model weights in runs/detect 📸
